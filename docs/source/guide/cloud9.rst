Cloud9
======
You can use AWS Cloud9 with Boto3 to write, run, and debug your Python code 
using just a browser. AWS Cloud9 provides an integrated development 
environment (IDE) that includes tools such as a code editor, 
debugger, and terminal. Because the AWS Cloud9 IDE is cloud based, 
you can work on your Python projects from your office, home, or anywhere using 
an internet-connected machine. For general information about AWS Cloud9, see the 
`AWS Cloud9 User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide>`_.

Prerequisites
-------------
You must already have an AWS account. If you don't have one, do this 
to create it:

#. Go to https://aws.amazon.com. 
#. Choose **Sign In to the Console**.
#. Choose **Create a new AWS account**. 
#. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish creating the account.

Step 1: Set up your AWS account
-------------------------------
Start to use AWS Cloud9 by signing in to the AWS Cloud9 console as 
an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) entity (for example, 
an IAM user) in your AWS account who has access permissions for AWS Cloud9.

To set up an IAM entity in your AWS account to access AWS Cloud9, 
and to sign in to the AWS Cloud9 console, see 
`Team Setup <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/setup.html>`_ 
in the *AWS Cloud9 User Guide*.

Step 2: Create an environment
-----------------------------
After you sign in to the AWS Cloud9 console, use the console to 
create an AWS Cloud9 development environment. (A *development environment* 
is a place where you store your project's files and where you run the tools 
to develop your apps.) After you create 
the environment, AWS Cloud9 automatically opens the IDE for that environment.

To create an AWS Cloud9 development environment, see 
`Creating an Environment <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/create-environment.html>`_ 
in the *AWS Cloud9 User Guide*.

Step 3: Set up credentials
--------------------------
To call AWS services from Python code in your environment, you must provide a 
set of AWS authentication credentials along with each call that your 
code makes. If you created an AWS Cloud9 EC2 development environment 
in the previous step, then AWS Cloud9 automatically set up these 
credentials in your environment, and you can skip ahead to the next step.

If, however, you created an AWS Cloud9 SSH development environment, you must 
manually set up these credentials in your environment. 
To set up these credentials, see 
`Call AWS Services from an Environment <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/credentials.html>`_ 
in the *AWS Cloud9 User Guide*.

Step 4: Install Boto3
----------------------
After AWS Cloud9 opens the IDE for your development environment, use the IDE 
to set up Boto3. To do this, use the terminal in the IDE to 
run this command:

    sudo pip install boto3

If the terminal isn't already open in the IDE, open it. To do this, 
on the menu bar in the IDE, choose **Window, New Terminal**.

You can also install a specific version:

    sudo pip install boto3==1.0.0

.. note::

   The latest development version can always be found on
   `GitHub <https://github.com/boto/boto3>`_.

Step 5: Download example code
-----------------------------
Use the terminal that you opened in the previous step, download example code 
for Boto3 into your AWS Cloud9 development environment. To do this, 
use the terminal in the IDE to run this command: 

    git clone https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples.git

This command downloads 
a copy of many of the code examples used across the official AWS SDK 
documentation into your environment's root directory.

To find the code examples for Boto3, use the **Environment** window to open 
the :code:`your-environment-name/aws-doc-sdk-examples/python/example_code` 
directory, where :code:`your-environment-name` is the name of your 
development environment.

To learn how to work with these and other code examples, see 
:ref:`Code Examples <aws-boto3-examples>`.

Step 6: Run and debug code
--------------------------
To run your Python code in your AWS Cloud9 development environment, see 
`Run Your Code <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/build-run-debug.html#build-run-debug-run>`_ 
in the *AWS Cloud9 User Guide*.

To debug your Python code, see 
`Debug Your Code <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/build-run-debug.html#build-run-debug-debug>`_ 
in the *AWS Cloud9 User Guide*.
