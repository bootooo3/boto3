This section describes code examples that demonstrate how to use the AWS SDK
for Python to call various AWS services. The source files for the examples, 
plus additional example programs, are available in the `AWS Code 
Catalog <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/python/example_code>`_.

To propose a new code example for the AWS documentation team to consider producing, create a new request. 
The team is looking to produce code examples that cover broader scenarios and use cases, 
versus simple code snippets that cover only individual API calls. For instructions, see 
the "Proposing new code examples" section in the 
`Readme on GitHub <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/README.rst>`_. 

Before running an example, your AWS credentials must be configured as 
described in :doc:`quickstart`.
