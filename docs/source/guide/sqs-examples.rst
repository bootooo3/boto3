The code examples in this section demonstrate using the Amazon Web Services 
(AWS) SDK for Python to call the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS). 
For more information about Amazon SQS, see the `Amazon SQS documentation
<http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sqs/>`_.

Each code example requires that your AWS credentials have been configured as 
described in :ref:`guide_quickstart`. Some examples require additional
prerequisites which are described in the example's section.

The source files for these and other code examples are available in the 
`AWS Code Catalog <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/python/example_code>`_
on GitHub.
