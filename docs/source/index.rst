Boto3 documentation
====================

You use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to create, configure, and manage AWS services, such as Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The SDK provides
an object-oriented API as well as low-level access to AWS services.

.. note::

    Documentation and developers tend to refer to the AWS SDK for Python as "Boto3," and this
    documentation often does so as well.
