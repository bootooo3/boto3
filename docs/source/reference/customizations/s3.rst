S3 transfers
------------

.. note::

   All classes documented below are considered public and thus will not be
   exposed to breaking changes. If a class from the ``boto3.s3.transfer``
   module is not documented below, it is considered internal and users
   should be very cautious in directly using them because breaking changes may
   be introduced from version to version of the library. It is recommended to
   use the variants of the transfer functions injected into the S3 client
   instead.
